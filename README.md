# SonicRunners-Archive
This repository is a public archive of past versions of Sonic Runners and Sonic Runners Revival that have been confirmed to be working and self-hostable. 


# In order to play older versions of the game you need to run a local server
You can setup your own private server by following the steps given in the Outrun repo
https://github.com/fluofoxxo/outrun

Alternatively, you can also use [Outrun for Revival](https://github.com/RunnersRevival/outrun), which fixes a variety of issues and implements login bonusses, among other stuff.
This fork of Outrun is highly recommended for hosting Revival clients.

# You *NEED* a web server to host server-side assets, outrun CAN'T do this
There are a couple of tools for this, if you are running Windows you can set up a web server
pretty easily using software like "Apache" or "Abyss Web Server x1".
